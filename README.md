WHT-NG
======

**#m in the process of rewriting the whole thing using Symfony Framework as our *CORE*.**

Web Hosting Toolkit Next Generation (WHT-NG) is a software for maintaining commercial (PayPal) or free (with header, footer and pop-up) webhosting server. It can create system user for ftp access, create many virtual domains and subdomains owned by the user, create many virtual email accounts for every domain, create MySQL databases, view traffic statistic ...

WHT-NG is based on the software written by Nikolay Ivanov found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/whtrecode. This was very good at the time it was last released, but development discontinued. I had the software working with Debian, although it was writen for RedHat Linux.
